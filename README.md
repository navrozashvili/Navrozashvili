# Elgato avea
Since android 10 update Elgato Avea lightbulb android application is no longer maintained so it got removed from play store. Goal of this repo is to regain control on the light bulb using chromium's ble capabilities
# Progress
Added:
brightness control<br/>
controls to set rgb color<br/>
controls to transition from one color to another to kinda mimic scenes<br/>
bulb notification handling<br/>
# Issues
For some reason it will revert back to old color once you turn off and turn on the bulb.
